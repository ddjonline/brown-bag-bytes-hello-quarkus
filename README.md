This is a basic "hello, world" training project to demonstrate getting a _very_ basic Quarkus web (REST) application started running locally.

This project is not intended to demonstrate the numerous capabilities of Quarkus or Java development but simply as a whetting of the appetite.

## Getting started

Install Java 17 or above

Install Maven 3.8.x or above

## Training

This training is split into multiple stages and controlled by the project's branches. Checkout each "step" branch in turn or simply checkout the "final_result" project branch to see the completed project.

### Steps

1. [Step 1](README_STEP_1.md)
2. [Step 2](README_STEP_2.md)
3. [Step 3](README_STEP_3.md)
4. [Step 4](README_STEP_4.md)

If you want to follow along via Git, look at branches `step_1`, `step_2`, `step_3`, `step_4`, and `final` in case you do not want to type in the code or if you run into trouble.

Have fun!
